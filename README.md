# snaky-rhythm

Snaky Rhythm is a tiny game combining the _Snake_ and rhythm, participating GitHub Game Off 2018.

## Introduction

This is a modification of traditional _Snake_ game. The snake goes with the rhythm!

Use arrow keys to control the snake.

Take care of the bottom bar: **you can only control the snake when "x" is turning green**.

If you have a good sense of music, this game should not be hard :)
